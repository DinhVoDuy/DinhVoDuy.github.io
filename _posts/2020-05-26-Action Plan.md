## Action Plan
For my academic plan, I would like to code a program for personal use by July 1st, 2020 in either Python or C++. This will make me learn new programming languages since I already have experience with Java, and help me improve my programming skill to read and execute code better since I was struggling to use Github for the reflection assignment. The program for my goal should be bug-free, and all aspects of the program should work as intended and have decent/usable UI. I canâ€™t think of the purpose of this app but I want it to be gaming related or to a specific game like an in-game statistic calculator. For my personal goal. I would like to go to the gym 5 times a week on June 1st, 2020 and maintain it until August 1st, 2020 once I have school again I would like to maintain 4 days a week but it depends on my school schedule. By July I want to drop 5 kilograms in weight and be able to complete my program goal.
