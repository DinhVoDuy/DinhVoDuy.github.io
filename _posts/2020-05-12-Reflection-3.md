## Reflection 3
In the third week, nothing really happens since there is a holiday break on Tuesday meaning I only have 1 class day and it follows the same topic I already learnt in the previous course. The big highlight of the week for me is my friend, who I havenâ€™t seen in two years came back on Sunday. The gaming world in terms of new technologies and big advances in game design also slows down. I planned my future fitness goal since a good friend of mine is coming back next week and he works out every day back in he was in Canada with his help I believe that I will be in better shape in the future which in turn makes me become a programmer in the future. To achieve my goal of becoming a full game developer, and develop my own games in the future. I need to be in better shape since it helps with my posture and cognitive ability through long hours of working. At the beginning of my fitness journey, I will consistently go to the gym 3 times a week and by the end of this course, I want to go 5 times a week. In short, going to the gym consistently will increase my stamina to do school work and later on my future jobs with better efficiency.
