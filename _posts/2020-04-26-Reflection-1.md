## Reflection 1

Week one of this course covers the future program of each student and the grading system. Since I am already familiar with the credit system used to graduate from my
high school experience there is not much to learn. However, the future program specifically the software engineering course outline and information about the 3 main
computer labs was helpful. On the other hand, there are a few overlapping topics like citation and research I already learn from the previous courses, it feels like a
waste of time for me. The highlight of the week was an interview podcast with a game developer/designer, I found this podcast a long time ago but I recently watch the
interview on Friday. Game developing and designing is the field I want to be in someday as I want to make my own game before I retired, this video touch on many game
design subject as they go through some game release in 2019 (Ranton 2019). The main concepts I got from this video are combat design and game development timeline. The
guest is a well-known game director Cesar, he has an interesting take on God of War 2018 combat, which was regarded as a great combat system. But Cesar thinks that it is
a bad combat system in terms of technicality since it doesn’t require a lot of thinking or reaction combined with great visuals making a satisfying illusion of an
engaging combat system without the sustain to back it up (Ranton 2019). To me, this way of doing a combat system is good and bad since the development time to create
this system is greatly reduced since the bulk of the combat feels is coming from visual and sound design. This can be bad if the visual isn’t creative enough leading to
a monotonous and bland clicking simulator. The second thing Cesar brings up is the tight deadline of a triple a game, the publisher usually gives out 1 to 2 years for a
game to finish, but most of the time this leads to a hellish development cycle as the developer has to crunch and work extra hours unpaid for the game as big as a modern
standard game needed at least 3 to 4 years to complete without bug or glitches (Ranton 2019). Hearing this makes me question my future choice but relife to hear, that
this work culture will be regulated and hopefully begone when I’m graduate.
